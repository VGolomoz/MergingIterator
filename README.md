MergingIterator

Given:
N sorted iterators of integers.

The task:
Implement iterator (Iterator<Integer>) that produces globally sorted sequence from the given N iterators. Task must be solved in the most efficient way possible (i.e it's not allowed  to copy entire content of iterators into some structure and then sort it).
